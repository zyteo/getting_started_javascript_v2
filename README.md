# Getting started with JavaScript, V2

## Taking this course on Frontend Masters

Doing a refresher on JavaScript because the last 2 years I have been building stuff with JS, and not so much focused on leetcode stuff. I think going through a refresher course would be helpful in leetcoding again.

This course was created back in 2019 and I acknowledge some time has passed. I will adapt the code I see accordingly. For example, when I see var, I will change it to let or const instead.
